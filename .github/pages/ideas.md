- heading link markdown anchor style


```
I'm going to paste two links. One is an index of blog posts, one is a specific blog post:

1. Index: https://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/
2. Specific: https://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/markup-syntax-highlighting/

We're going to take this and create a single page, with the markdown at the end of this message as the template. Requirements:

1. Simplify the top bar, sticky. Title is 'Hacker Laws', next button is 'Effective Shell [book icon]' then 'Sponsor [coffee icon]' then 'Terminal AI [brain icon]' then 'GitHub [github icon, this item right aligned]'
2. Use bootstrap and bootstrap icons so that we have a CSS starting point eg. for the grid
3. Use the social sharing icons below each 'law'
4. There is no need to link to any content pages - this is a single page
5. Below each law we need a 'back to top' button, choose 3-5 options so that I can pick the one I prefer, think about common patterns used to visually indicate 'go to top'
6. No need for disqus
7. Theme should be soft pastel colors, prefer a paper colored background perhaps very slightly yellow like parchment
8. No logo at the top, but Hacker Laws in slightly larger text with the subtitle
```
